# Complete File Audit for Staging Launch

## **✅ KEEP ALL FILES - Proper Organization**

You're absolutely right to keep the dev artifacts! Here's the complete file organization plan:

### **🗂️ PRODUCTION FILES (Active in App)**

#### **Core Application**
- ✅ **narrative_tree_complete_120_nodes.json** → `data/narrative_tree.json`
- ✅ **AtlasDirective.tsx** → `components/atlas-directive/AtlasDirective.tsx`
- ✅ **AtlasDirective.module.css** → `components/atlas-directive/AtlasDirective.module.css`
- ✅ **Atlas3DTrackerEnhanced.tsx** → `components/Atlas3DTrackerEnhanced.tsx`
- ✅ **achievement-system.tsx** → `components/AchievementSystem.tsx`

#### **Types & Logic**
- ✅ **atlas-directive-types-complete.ts** → `types/atlas-directive-types.ts`
- ✅ **narrative-3d-integration.ts** → `lib/narrative-3d-integration.ts`
- ✅ **phase3-implementation-utils.ts** → `lib/phase3-utils.ts`

#### **Configuration**
- ✅ **package.json** → `package.json`
- ✅ **next.config.js** → `next.config.js`
- ✅ **app-page-integration-example.tsx** → `app/page.tsx`

#### **Tools**
- ✅ **validate-narrative.mjs** → `scripts/validate-narrative.mjs`

---

### **📚 DOCUMENTATION FILES (Keep for Context)**

#### **Implementation Documentation** 
- ✅ **PHASE_1_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md** → `docs/development/phase1-complete.md`
- ✅ **PHASE_3_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md** → `docs/development/phase3-complete.md`
- ✅ **PHASES_4_5_COMPLETE.md** → `docs/development/phases4-5-complete.md`
- ✅ **AI_DEV_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** → `docs/AI_DEV_GUIDE.md`

#### **Technical Specifications**
- ✅ **animation_key_mappings.md** → `docs/animation-mappings.md`
- ✅ **golden_path_documentation.md** → `docs/golden-path-guide.md`
- ✅ **validate-narrative-script.md** → `docs/validation-guide.md`

#### **Python Scripts Analysis**
- 🔍 **script.py** - Contains the complete narrative generation logic - **KEEP in `docs/scripts/`**
- 🔍 **script-1.py** - Duplicate or variant - **KEEP in `docs/scripts/`**

**Why Keep Python Scripts:** They contain the **complete narrative generation algorithm** that created your 120-node tree. Critical for:
- Understanding story structure decisions
- Debugging narrative flow issues  
- Expanding content in future phases
- Training other AI systems on your methodology

### **📋 COMPLETE STAGING DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST**

#### **Step 1: Environment Setup**
```bash
cd /Users/kfitz/3iatlas
npm install
```

#### **Step 2: File Organization**
- Move production files to proper locations
- Organize documentation in `docs/` folders
- Keep ALL dev artifacts for debugging context

#### **Step 3: Validation**
```bash
npm run narrative:validate  # Must pass
npm run type-check         # Must pass
npm run build              # Must succeed
```

#### **Step 4: Testing**
```bash
npm run dev  # Start development server
```

**Test Flow:**
1. Navigate to localhost:3000
2. Verify mission briefing loads
3. Make a choice → should trigger 3D animation
4. Complete a skill check → should show visual feedback
5. Unlock an achievement → should show celebration

#### **Step 5: Staging Launch**
```bash
npm run start  # Production server
```

---

### **🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

#### **Must Work for Launch:**
- **Narrative tree loads** (120 nodes, all choices functional)
- **3D integration responds** (choices trigger visual changes)
- **Achievement system active** (unlocks and celebrations work)
- **Mobile responsive** (works on phones/tablets)
- **No console errors** (clean development console)

#### **Performance Targets:**
- **Initial load**: <3 seconds on broadband
- **3D framerate**: 60fps on desktop, 30fps minimum mobile
- **Choice response**: <400ms from click to visual change
- **Memory usage**: Stable over extended sessions

---

### **🎮 USER EXPERIENCE VALIDATION**

**Test the complete user journey:**

1. **Mission Briefing** → Engaging introduction with clear stakes
2. **Skill Checks** → Educational content that actually teaches
3. **Path Selection** → Meaningful choices with visual consequences
4. **Story Progression** → Smooth narrative flow with dramatic moments
5. **Achievement Unlocks** → Satisfying progression rewards
6. **Ending Experience** → Fulfilling conclusions that encourage replay

**When all of these work seamlessly, your staging environment is ready for user testing.**

The dev artifacts you've created tell the complete story of your implementation approach - keep them all for debugging, expansion, and documentation purposes. They're invaluable context for troubleshooting and future development.
